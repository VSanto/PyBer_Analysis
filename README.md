# PyBer_Analysis

The purpose of the new analysis is to analys the 2019 quarter one data, to see where improvemets can be made.

The data shows majorty of the rides are in the urban areas.  Rural areas have more transportaion options, thus resulting in lower rides.  Suburban areas have an increase in rides but not nearly as much as the urban areas.

# Recommendations
Based on the results of the analysis 
I recommend:
1.  Provide monthly incentive to drivers. 
3.  Additional research for the rural and suburban areas on ways to increase rides.
4.  Offer discounts to regular customers
